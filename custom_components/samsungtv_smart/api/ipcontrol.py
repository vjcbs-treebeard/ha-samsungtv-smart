"""Samsung IP Control (JSON-RPC) client.

Talks to recent Samsung TVs over the undocumented JSON-RPC interface on
HTTPS port 1516. This is used as a reliable, SmartThings-free power path on
Frame TVs: the WebSocket KEY_POWER command only toggles between normal viewing
and Art Mode, whereas `powerControl` issues an explicit hardware on/off that
works from any state (including Art Mode).

Protocol notes (confirmed on Frame 2024 / 2025):
  * HTTPS POST to https://<ip>:1516/ with a self-signed certificate (no verify).
  * Only Accept + Content-Type headers are sent.
  * Two-step auth: `createAccessToken` returns a token after the user accepts an
    on-screen prompt; the token is then passed in `params.AccessToken` on every
    later call. The token persists across power cycles (pair once).
  * Pairing only works while the TV is OUT of Art Mode; in Art Mode the endpoint
    does not respond and the request times out.
  * The TV must have "IP Remote" enabled
    (Settings -> Connections -> Network -> Expert Settings).
  * Older Samsung TVs (Tizen <= 5.5, ~2020 Frames) negotiate a weak DH group
    that OpenSSL's default security level rejects ("dh key too small"). The
    client detects this and transparently retries with @SECLEVEL=0.

The blocking HTTP work runs in the executor so the event loop is never blocked.
The SSL context is also built lazily inside the executor — `create_default_context`
loads CA certs from disk, which would block the event loop if done at __init__.
